# Password Generator

## Description:
    Program generates a password based on a number of catagories that the user can confirm or deny their usage. The catagories are as follow:

    * Lower Case Letters
    * Upper Case Letters
    * Numbers
    * Special Characters

## Walk Through:

     1. User will click on the button "Generate Password". User will be prompted to choose the length of their password by inputing a number. Password will generate a password between 8 and 129 Characters. Anything outside of that range or any non-numeric number will not be accepted and an error message will display.

     2. Once a viable number has been chosen, a series of questions will be asked to confirm or deny the programs usage of Lower Case, Upper Case, Numeric Case and Special Characters. 

     3. Once all prompts have been run, the program will use randomness to choose both the catagory of acceptable character as well as a random character in that catagory. Once the program has chosen enough characters based on the requested user length, the new password will be displayed for the User.
